# x4prosim: instructions for helper agents

x4prosim is based on upstream **QEMU 11.1.2**, with ported Espressif SoC models,
and simulates the **Xteink X4 Pro** (ESP32-S3R8, 16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM) closely enough to run **any
unmodified X4 Pro firmware**: the stock firmware, CrossInk, CrossDink, or a bare
ESP-IDF/Arduino app. It also simulates the **Xteink X3** (ESP32-C3; see the X3
section) for the CrossPoint X3/X4 binary. The goal is firmware development without the physical device:
the screen, SD card, keys, touch, clock and battery behave like the board.

Rule zero: **never change a firmware to make it boot in QEMU.** Model the hardware
instead, from the datasheets and the board, not from one firmware's driver: another
firmware may use the same chip differently (hardware SPI CS, DMA, other panel
commands). CrossDink (`prokrypt/CrossDink`, read-only for you) is the reference
firmware for testing because its drivers are readable and it logs a lot.

## Porting layers

See [x4prosim/porting/README.md](x4prosim/porting/README.md) for the QEMU 11.1.2
porting branches, layer ownership, build command and commit rules.

## Repo, branches, workflow

- Repo: `prokrypt/x4prosim`. Integration branch: **`x4prosim`** (base: upstream
  QEMU 11.1.2).
- Work on your own branch off `x4prosim` (name it `ext/<area>`, e.g. `ext/i2c`) and
  open a PR into `x4prosim`. Keep each PR to one peripheral.
- Only touch the files your task names plus `hw/xtensa/esp32s3.c` (machine wiring)
  and the matching `meson.build`/`Kconfig`. Ask before editing shared files
  someone else owns (table below).
- Style: QEMU C style, 4-space indent. One-line comment only where the why isn't
  obvious. Each new device: a short header comment naming the registers it models
  and what it fakes.
- Commit messages: `x4prosim: <what>`.

## Build and run

Use Python 3.9 or newer, GLib 2.66 or newer, and libgcrypt 1.9.4 or newer
(Debian 12 satisfies these requirements). QEMU configure selects Meson 1.5 or
newer, installing the bundled 1.11.1 wheel when needed. Rust is disabled by
default in this QEMU 11.1.2 tree; no Rust toolchain is needed for these builds.
A fresh configure needs network access for missing Python packages and subprojects.

```sh
# deps (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential git pkg-config ninja-build libglib2.0-dev \
  libpixman-1-dev libpng-dev libgcrypt20-dev libslirp-dev libsdl2-dev \
  dosfstools mtools python3 python3-venv
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install esptool
mkdir build && cd build
../configure --target-list=xtensa-softmmu,riscv32-softmmu --enable-gcrypt --enable-slirp --enable-sdl --enable-png \
  --disable-gnutls --disable-strip --disable-user --disable-capstone --disable-vnc --disable-gtk --disable-docs
ninja qemu-system-xtensa qemu-system-riscv32
```
macOS: `brew install glib pixman ninja pkg-config python3 libgcrypt libpng libslirp sdl2 dosfstools mtools`.

Firmware image: any 16 MB X4 Pro flash image. Three ways to get one:
- A dump of a real device: `esptool.py --chip esp32s3 read_flash 0 0x1000000 flash.bin`
  (works only if the device doesn't use flash encryption).
- A PlatformIO or ESP-IDF build: `x4prosim/mkflash.sh <build dir> flash.bin` merges
  `bootloader.bin`, `partitions.bin` and the app (`firmware.bin`, or the only other
  `.bin`) at 0x0/0x8000/0x10000.
- A single app `.bin` released as an OTA update: flash a bootloader and partition
  table first (from any build), then the app at 0x10000.

CrossDink example: `pio run -e x4-pro-debug` in a CrossDink checkout, then:

```sh
x4prosim/mkflash.sh <CrossDink>/.pio/build/x4-pro-debug flash.bin
x4prosim/run.sh flash.bin sd.img          # firmware log (USB-CDC) on stdout, SDL window if available
x4prosim/drive.py flash.bin sd.img log.txt wait:30 shot:home.png   # headless
```

`run.sh`/`drive.py` create a 1 GB MBR+FAT32 `sd.img` if it doesn't exist (`x4prosim/mksd.py sd.img 1024 books/` copies a folder in). Keep

### CrossDink build gotchas (PlatformIO, pioarduino 6.1.19)

- **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'SCons.Tool.FortranCommon'`** at the
  `firmware.elf` link step: the `tool-scons` package is half-installed. Delete it
  and rebuild; pio reinstalls it: `rm -rf ~/.platformio/packages/tool-scons`.
- **`*** Reinstall Arduino framework ***`** on the first build in a new checkout is
  normal (pioarduino keys its hybrid-compiled IDF on `sdkconfig.defaults`). It
  re-downloads `framework-arduinoespressif32` from GitHub releases and recompiles
  the IDF libs, so the first build takes several minutes.
- **`CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` / `self-signed certificate in certificate chain`**
  during that download: pio's own Python uses its bundled certifi, which doesn't
  trust a corporate or sandbox proxy CA. Point it at the system bundle:
  `ln -sf /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt "$(~/.platformio/penv/bin/python -c 'import certifi; print(certifi.where())')"`
  (or your proxy's CA file).
- **Never run two `pio run` at once**, even in different checkouts: they share
  `~/.platformio` and one will wipe the framework under the other.
- CI artifacts carry `firmware.bin` only. You need a local build for
  `firmware.elf` (symbols), `bootloader.bin` and `partitions.bin`.

`firmware.elf` beside you for symbols. To find a hang: run with `-s -S`, attach
`xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gdb firmware.elf` (`target remote :1234`), let it run, Ctrl-C,
`bt`. Or `info registers -a` on the HMP socket `/tmp/x4prosim-mon.sock` and
`xtensa-esp32s3-elf-addr2line -pfiaC -e firmware.elf <PC>`.

Unmapped peripheral registers read as 0 and ignore writes (catch-all
`esp32s3.iomem`), so a missing model usually shows up as a busy-wait on a status
bit, an `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, or a timeout in the log. Map new devices with
`memory_region_add_subregion_overlap(..., 1)` so they win over the catch-all.

## WebAssembly build

The Emscripten build uses Kohei Tokunaga's **wasm64 TCG JIT backend**: cold
translation blocks run through TCI, and hot blocks become Wasm modules at
runtime. Both X3 (`qemu-system-riscv32.js`) and X4 Pro
(`qemu-system-xtensa.js`) are built. This replaces the older QEMU 9.2.2 TCI
port on `serialx/wasm`; firmware images need no changes.

### Build and choose an address mode

Use Emscripten **6.0.12** (also pinned in CI), Python 3.9+ and Node **26**.
The local verification used Homebrew Emscripten 6.0.12 and Node 26.11.0 on
macOS arm64. On Linux, install and activate emsdk 6.0.12 before building.

```sh
# macOS prerequisites
brew install emscripten ninja pkg-config autoconf automake libtool dosfstools mtools
# Ubuntu prerequisites (plus activated emsdk 6.0.12)
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool libltdl-dev pkg-config ninja-build \
  meson python3-venv texinfo gettext dosfstools mtools

x4prosim/wasm/build-deps.sh          # build-wasm-deps/sysroot-wasm64
x4prosim/wasm/build.sh --web         # default: build-wasm-32limit/web-dist
x4prosim/wasm/run-node.sh flash.bin sd.img
python3 x4prosim/wasm/serve.py build-wasm-32limit/web-dist
```

Both modes use 64-bit host pointers and the same wasm64 dependency sysroot.
The mode controls the emitted Wasm memory addressing, not the guest CPU:

| Selection | Emscripten setting | Output directory | Browser requirement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `WASM64_MODE=32` (default) | `MEMORY64=2`, 32-bit address limit | `build-wasm-32limit/` | No Memory64 required; compatible with modern Chrome, Firefox and Safari |
| `WASM64_MODE=64` | `MEMORY64=1`, native Memory64 | `build-wasm/` | Chrome 133+, Firefox 134+; not Safari |

Memory64 support is tracked in [MDN's compatibility data](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/webassembly/memory64.json).
The default mode is the portable option across those browsers. Both modes
still require Wasm threads, exception handling and cross-origin isolation.
Actual emulator acceptance was run in **Chrome 155**, with GPU/WebGL enabled,
and Node 26; Firefox and Safari have not been tested with this emulator.

```sh
# Native Memory64: keep the mode consistent for build, launch and packaging.
WASM64_MODE=64 x4prosim/wasm/build.sh --web
WASM64_MODE=64 x4prosim/wasm/run-node.sh flash.bin sd.img
python3 x4prosim/wasm/serve.py build-wasm/web-dist
```

`JOBS` sets build parallelism; `EM_CACHE` selects a writable compiler cache.
For a fresh checkout, export `WASM_SYSROOT=/absolute/path/to/sysroot-wasm64`
before both build scripts to reuse dependencies built with the same compiler.
Do not reuse the old TCI port's 32-bit sysroot. Installed dependencies are
skipped; `FORCE=1` rebuilds them. Do not rebuild a shared sysroot concurrently.
The scripts pin dependency sources and keep generated files in ignored build
directories. QEMU configure can download missing Python packages/subprojects.

### Run, package and verify

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, choose a 16 MiB flash image and optionally an SD
image, or use `?flash=flash.bin&sd=sd.img` with copies in the served directory.
Bootloader byte 12 equal to 5 selects X3; otherwise the launcher selects X4 Pro.
The browser has a portrait SDL panel, CDC log, keys and X4 Pro pointer input.
Reset resets the guest; Stop retains the SD in page memory for the next Start.
Download SD image saves guest writes. Closing or reloading loses unsaved
changes; flash changes are not exported. A blank 64 MiB FAT32 card is included.

Node mounts host files under `/host`. `run-node.sh` copies flash into `.run`
but writes the supplied SD directly, so use a copy when testing. Ctrl-a c
selects the HMP monitor. Smoke tests copy both input images and save logs,
measurements and PPM panel captures under `build-wasm/evidence/smoke`:

```sh
x4prosim/wasm/smoke.sh flash.bin sd.img  # X3 Home, JIT activity, X4 Pro ROM/panel
x4prosim/wasm/smoke.sh --rom-only       # no firmware; used in CI
x4prosim/wasm/package-web.sh           # package existing default-mode binaries
```

Use `WASM64_MODE=64` with smoke/packaging for the native Memory64 build.
`WASM_JIT_STATS=1` on the Node launcher logs successfully instantiated TB
modules. `REFERENCE_PPM=/absolute/path/to/native.ppm` makes smoke compare the
X3 capture byte for byte. Browser automation and controls are documented in
[x4prosim/wasm/web/README.txt](x4prosim/wasm/web/README.txt).

The launchers use ordinary TCG blocks with a 64 MiB translation cache and
`-icount shift=0,sleep=on` for X3 (`shift=2` for X4 Pro). The Wasm backend
learns recurring MMIO boundaries to avoid repeated mid-block exits. Native
Wasm longjmp and fixed 256 MiB linear memory reduce runtime overhead.
For larger workloads, rebuild with `WASM_INITIAL_MEMORY=<bytes>` or
`WASM_MEMORY_GROWTH=1`; growth can cost performance. `WASM_ACCEL` overrides
the Node accelerator setting; `RUN_NODE_SLEEP=off` disables idle-time warping
for deterministic timing comparisons in accurate mode (`sleep=on` otherwise).

**Turbo is the default** for the browser page and the Node launcher: the
**Turbo (fast, not timing-accurate)** checkbox starts ticked and `run-node.sh`
behaves as `TURBO=1`. Select accurate timing with `?turbo=0` in the browser or
`TURBO=0 x4prosim/wasm/run-node.sh flash.bin sd.img`. The native launcher keeps
accurate timing by default; `X4TURBO=1 x4prosim/run.sh flash.bin sd.img` opts
in. Turbo retains `-icount` with `sleep=off`, minimizes SD and panel delays,
and opts into GPSPI `zero-wire-time` synchronous transfers; X3 BUSY pulses
retain a 1 ms minimum. Removing `icount` made transfer timers depend on host
scheduling, slowing native boot and stalling Node. Turbo reaches settled
startup in 4.789 s in Node and 5.558 s in Chrome, faster than the device end
to end, but **changes guest timing and must not be used for timing
measurements**. `smoke.sh` runs accurate mode (it passes `TURBO=0`);
`smoke.sh --turbo flash.bin sd.img` compares the panel against a fresh native
turbo reference without requiring timestamp equality.

### CI and hosting

The separate `wasm` job leaves the native build matrix unchanged. It runs
`build-deps.sh`, `build.sh --web` (which calls `package-web.sh`) and
`smoke.sh --rom-only`, then uploads `x4prosim-<version>-wasm`. The wasm64
sysroot/compiler cache key includes the SDK version and dependency recipes.
The artifact contains both emulators, ROMs, browser assets and the blank card;
it contains no firmware or user SD images.

Pages uploads and deploys only on **pushes to `serialx/wasm-jit` in
`serialx/x4prosim`**, to <https://serialx.github.io/x4prosim/>.
`WASM_PAGES_BRANCH` in the workflow is the single branch setting (change it to
`x4prosim` once the branch is merged); other branches, PRs and forks do not
deploy. The repository has **Settings > Pages > Source: GitHub Actions** enabled
and the branch allowed in the `github-pages` environment. The hosted page ships
no firmware: choose a flash image with the file picker.

`serve.py` sets COOP/COEP headers for SharedArrayBuffer and pthreads. On Pages,
the bundled MIT-licensed `coi-serviceworker` supplies isolation and reloads
once on first visit. Use HTTPS or localhost; service workers must be allowed
when the server cannot set those headers. Local header-less hosting passed
with this service worker. The package makes no runtime CDN requests.

### Measurements and limits

CrossPoint 1.6.5 X3, Apple M5 Max (18 logical CPUs, 128 GiB RAM), macOS arm64,
Emscripten 6.0.12, Node 26.11.0, Chrome 155. These final `MEMORY64=2` figures
are medians of three fresh-process runs with original flash/SD copies and no
concurrent builds or profilers. Home is the third completed `X3_DRF` refresh;
settled is the first subsequent `[MEM]` line after thumbnail generation.
Chrome times include navigation, image loading and startup, with GPU/WebGL on.
Each column is an independent median, so phase medians need not sum to total.

| Runtime / mode | Home | Home → settled | Settled total |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Native, accurate `sleep=off` | 1.785 s | 8.789 s | 10.574 s |
| Native, accurate `sleep=on` | 4.124 s | 11.695 s | 15.819 s |
| Node, old TCI port, `sleep=on` (historical) | 16.209 s | — | 108.470 s |
| Node JIT, accurate `sleep=off` | 2.394 s | 10.064 s | 12.464 s |
| Node JIT, accurate `sleep=on` (`TURBO=0`) | 4.635 s | 13.073 s | 17.708 s |
| Chrome, old TCI port (historical) | 19.79 s | — | 145.46 s |
| Chrome JIT, accurate `sleep=off` | 3.069 s | 11.656 s | 14.758 s |
| Chrome JIT, accurate `sleep=on` (`?turbo=0`) | 5.264 s | 14.091 s | 19.355 s |
| Node JIT, turbo (default) | 1.097 s | 3.706 s | 4.789 s |
| Chrome JIT, turbo (default) | 1.636 s | 3.917 s | 5.558 s |

Accurate `sleep=off` reaches Home faster than the device in both Node and
Chrome (guest 3.250 s), but settled startup still takes 1.24x/1.47x guest
time (about 10.05 s). The thumbnail phase itself takes 1.48x/1.71x its
6.799 s of guest time. The accurate-mode settled target remains unmet;
turbo meets the numeric targets by changing device delays.

All final native, Node and Chrome panel captures match byte for byte. Accurate
`sleep=off` preserves the first eight native firmware wait timestamps;
`sleep=on` can vary with host scheduling, including natively. Both address
modes build and pass smoke; native Memory64 was not rebenchmarked in the final
series. The old TCI rows were not rerun and compare different QEMU versions,
not an isolated backend change. Earlier measurements found higher Node RSS
with the JIT (835 MiB versus TCI 541 MiB); final RSS was not remeasured as a
controlled comparison. Detailed experiments and rejected candidates are in
[the performance report](x4prosim/wasm/perf/turbo-profile.md).

### What to upstream

Keep these as separate reviewable changes, with their correctness and A/B evidence:

- Empty auxiliary timer-list wakeup guard (`util/qemu-timer.c`).
- Direct dispatch for simple subpage MMIO (`system/physmem.c`, `accel/tcg/cputlb.c`).
- Synchronous SD media checks for ordinary images (`block/block-backend.c`, `hw/sd/sd.c`).
- Learned MMIO block boundaries (`accel/tcg/translate-all.c`).
- Exact SHA callback signatures and the intmatrix `BIT_ULL` fix in the ESP32 models.
- SDL browser input polling that drains the proxy queue without yielding under BQL
  (`ui/sdl2.c`), for the Emscripten port.

BQL batching was not retained because native Home non-regression was not
established. Turbo changes timing and should remain separate from the
accurate-mode optimizations. Safari, Firefox and X4 Pro firmware were not
executed in this verification.

Wi-Fi is disabled in Wasm. Browser images consume their full logical size:
a sparse 1 GiB SD still takes 1 GiB, with extra copies for loading and export.
Start with the packaged 64 MiB card when possible. IndexedDB persistence is
not implemented. X4 Pro acceptance covers blank-flash ROM boot, panel creation
and pointer delivery without an error; no X4 Pro firmware image was available
to verify its Home screen or touch response. These tests do not establish
coverage for every firmware or all self-modifying-code/remapping cases.

## Where it stands (2026-10-08, 1007e firmware)

Machine `-machine x4pro` (in `hw/xtensa/esp32s3.c`: `x4pro_board_init`) boots the
unmodified `x4-pro-debug` image to the Home screen, takes key presses and renders
the panel.

Done on `x4prosim`:
- Octal PSRAM 8 MB (default on `x4pro`), plus a PSRAM bounds fix.
- `hw/misc/esp32s3_usb_jtag.c`: USB-CDC console (firmware log) to a chardev.
- `hw/misc/esp32s3_sens.c`: SAR ADC oneshot always "done" (IDF calibration at boot).
- `hw/gpio/esp32s3_gpio.c`: real GPIO model: OUT/ENABLE/IN, edge/level
  interrupts, named lines `pin-in` (drive a pin from outside), `pin-out` (pin level
  to a device), `wake` (light-sleep GPIO wakeup). Undriven inputs read 1 (pull-up).
- `hw/ssi/esp32s3_gpspi.c`: GPSPI2 CPU-mode master (W0..W15 buffer, USR, TRANS_DONE).
- `hw/display/uc8179.c`: the X4 Pro's UC8179 panel on GPSPI2 with CS/DC/RST and
  BUSY_N on GPIO, plus the bit-banged SDA reads the firmware uses for its panel
  probe and OTP. Answers like the real panel (VER, FLG, OTP), so the firmware logs
  `controller=UC8179 ... promoted=1`. Graphic console shown portrait like the
  device (`portrait=false` for raw). `hw/display/ssd1677.c` is an unused SSD1677
  model kept for reference.
- UC8179 ink and ghosting (helper agent; full notes, data and tests in
  `x4prosim/ghosting/README.md`): each refresh (0x12) is simulated frame by frame
  instead of showing the planes, and plays on screen one frame per `frame-us`
  of virtual time (full refreshes flash, fast ones paint in). BUSY lasts the
  frames' length: boot full 1500 ms (device 1493), 50-frame direct gray 1250 ms
  (device 1189), DU 24 frames 600 ms (device 662).
  - PSR REG picks the waveform per refresh: REG=1 runs the uploaded register LUTs
    (0x20 VCOM, 0x21 WW, 0x22 KW, 0x23 WK, 0x24 KK); REG=0 runs stand-ins for the
    OTP waveforms (bodies never dumped): fast inside PTIN/PTOUT, full otherwise.
    CDI N2OCP copies NEW to OLD after the refresh.
  - Per pixel: saturating particle motion, two-component remnant voltage,
    blooming (edge loss), drift toward gray, shown linear in L*. Defaults are
    fitted to device photos: a typed-then-deleted word leaves ~11% ghost (device
    ~11%) that fades x0.53 over 6 fast refreshes (device x0.51); menus and gray
    book pages come out clean.
  - Every parameter is `-global uc8179.<name>=N` and 0 turns that mechanism off:
    `swing-frames` 6, `rail-soft` 100, `otp-fast-frames` 10,
    `otp-hold-drive` 6, `remnant-fast`/`-ms` 30/1000, `remnant-slow`/`-ms`
    10/30000, `bloom` 35, `drift`/`drift-s` 50/1800 (uncalibrated), `frame-us`
    25000. `otp-full-frames` is 30 (not 0 = off). Units and what each was fitted
    to: the notes, 3.4.
  - `busy-ms` 0 derives BUSY from the frames; nonzero fixes it. `animate=false`
    applies all frames at the DRF (BUSY still lasts the frames), for fast
    scripted runs. To capture the animation with `drive.py` (a screendump costs
    ~0.3 s), slow it: `-global uc8179.frame-us=100000`. A DRF during playback
    finishes the previous refresh first; RST stops it where it is.
  - Ink state is 16 B/pixel (6 MB) and the frame loop runs on QEMU's main loop.
  - Measure: `test/*-steps.txt` replay a scenario with `drive.py`,
    `tools/pepmeasure.py` / `seqmeasure.py` / `hist.py` read the screenshots,
    `tools/photomeasure.py` the device photos.
- `hw/display/esp_rgb.c`: the RGB console is created at realize, so `x4pro`
  (which never realizes it) no longer opens a stray black 800x600 SDL window.
- `hw/misc/esp32s3_sens.c`: temperature sensor always ready, 25 C (Goodies >
  Battery & Stats hung a core on it). `run.sh` shows the host cursor in SDL.
- X4 Pro uses `-icount shift=2` (set by `run.sh`/`drive.py`): guest time follows
  instructions, not host speed; without it FreeRTOS can assert after light sleep on a slow host.
  Guest runs slower than real time, so give `wait:` steps generous values.
- `x4prosim/testdata/`: real device logs, the panel OTP dump, battery history to
  seed the SD card, estimated power numbers. See its README.
- `hw/input/x4pro_keys.c`: Up/Down/Power keys (arrow keys + P, or
  `qom-set /machine/x4pro-keys down true`).
- `hw/misc/esp32s3_rtc_cntl.c`: light sleep: `SLEEP_EN` waits for the RTC timer
  alarm or a GPIO wake, and hides the sleep from the RTC counter so esp_timer
  isn't advanced twice.
- SD card: `x4prosim/mksd.py` makes an MBR + FAT32 image (SdFat needs the MBR);
  the existing `dwc_sdmmc` model mounts it.
- `x4prosim/drive.py`: headless runner with steps (`wait:S`, `press:down[:ms]`,
  `shot:file.png`, `hmp:cmd`). Example:
  `x4prosim/drive.py flash.bin sd.img log.txt wait:30 press:down shot:home.png`

- Wi-Fi: the MAC is emulated with a fake AP bridged to a QEMU NIC (port of the
  lcgamboa ESP32-C3 model: `hw/misc/esp32s3_wifi.c`, `esp32_wifi_ap.c`,
  `esp32_wlan_packet.c`; analog/FE in `esp32s3_ana.c`, `esp32_fe.c`). `run.sh`
  joins it to a network:
  - `X4BR=br0 x4prosim/run.sh ...` bridges to your LAN: the firmware does its own
    DHCP with your router and is reachable at that IP like a real device. Needs a
    host bridge `br0` holding your Ethernet port, `allow br0` in
    `/usr/local/etc/qemu/bridge.conf`, and root (the helper is `build/qemu-bridge-helper`).
    Wi-Fi host NICs can't be bridged; use Ethernet.
  - Default: QEMU NAT (`-nic user,model=esp32_wifi,hostfwd=tcp::8080-:80`), DHCP
    10.0.2.15, host port 8080 reaches the device's port 80 (`curl localhost:8080`).
  - `X4NET="-nic ..."` overrides both; `drive.py` takes the same `-nic` in `QEMU_EXTRA`.
  A scan finds `PICSimLabWifi` (open, ch 1, the one that connects), `Espressif` and
  `MasseyWifi`. With no `model=esp32_wifi` NIC the MAC is a stub and a scan finds 0.
  Station MAC: the NIC's `mac=` (default 52:54:00:12:34:56) is burned into efuse
  when no efuse file is given; give each sim on one LAN its own `mac=`.

Still missing: LEDC frontlight, charger STAT (GPIO21 reads 1 = charging), real Wi-Fi
(WPA, signal, other APs),
deep sleep with ext0/ext1 wake, USB OTG.

Gaps another firmware is likely to hit (CrossDink doesn't need them yet):
- GPSPI: DMA transfers (IDF `spi_master` uses DMA above 64 bytes), hardware CS,
  command/address/dummy phases, and half-duplex reads on SDA.
- GPIO matrix / IO_MUX routing: pins are wired directly, so a peripheral routed to
  a different pin than the X4 Pro's won't reach the device.
- UC8179: the 0x90 partial window, LUTBD (0x25), VDHR, VCOM_DC value and
  temperature (TSSET) aren't modeled; the OTP waveforms are stand-ins until the
  full 0xA2 OTP is dumped.
  Open calibration items: `x4prosim/ghosting/README.md` section 8.
- Flash encryption and secure boot.

## Xteink X3 (`-machine x3`, ESP32-C3)

The X3 is a different SoC: ESP32-C3 (RISC-V, 400 KB SRAM, no PSRAM), so it is a
second machine in `hw/riscv/esp32c3.c` (`x3_board_init`), built as
`qemu-system-riscv32`. `run.sh`, `drive.py` and `mkflash.sh` pick the machine
from the image's chip (byte 12 of the bootloader header), `X4MACHINE=x3|x4pro`
overrides. It runs the unmodified CrossPoint `crosspoint-<ver>-x3-x4.bin` (the dual
X3/X4 C3 binary) to Home, Library and Settings, with key presses, the battery from
the gauge and the SD card readable and writable. Hardware (freeink-sdk
`BoardConfig.h` `XTEINK_X3` / `XTEINK_X3_UC8279`):

| Area | Hardware | Pins / bus | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SoC blocks | the S3 models fit the C3's register maps: GPIO (`esp32s3_gpio.c`), GPSPI2 (`esp32s3_gpspi.c`), I2C0 (`esp32s3_i2c.c`), USB-CDC console (`esp32s3_usb_jtag.c`) | | wired for every C3 machine |
| Display | UC8279d 792x528 (newer units) or UC8253 (older), SPI 10 MHz, VER probed bit-banged | SCLK 8, SDA 10, CS 21, DC 4, RST 5, BUSY_N 6 | `hw/display/uc8279.c`; X3 defaults to UC8253 (VER floats); `-global uc8279.uc8253=false` selects UC8279d |
| SD | SPI mode on the same bus, SdFat; GPIO13 = rail enable | MISO 7, CS 12 | QEMU `ssi-sd` + `sd-card-spi`, `-drive if=sd` |
| Keys | ADC ladder: Back/Confirm/Left/Right on GPIO1 (ADC1 ch1), Up/Down on GPIO2 (ch2), raw 3512/2694/1493/5 and 2242/5, idle 4095; Power GPIO3 active-LOW | SAR ADC | `hw/misc/esp32c3_saradc.c` (one-shot), `hw/input/x3_keys.c`: arrows, Enter, Backspace/Esc, P; `qom-set /machine/x3-keys confirm true` |

| Wi-Fi | MAC + fake open AP bridged to `-nic user` | n/a | the S3 models at the same bases (`esp32s3_wifi.c`, `esp32s3_ana.c`, `esp32_fe.c`) |

Notes:
- X3 CPU timing uses `-icount shift=0,sleep=on` (selected by `run.sh` and
  `drive.py`), so each tick is 1 ns. CPU properties on `espressif-riscv-cpu`
  are `cost-rom-ns=6`, `cost-sram-ns=8`, `cost-flash-ns=10`, and additive
  `cost-load=0`, `cost-store=3`, `cost-mul=0`, `cost-div=160`, `cost-branch=2`.
  The clock registers select a factor relative to 160 MHz; 10 MHz costs 16x.
  Override with `-global espressif-riscv-cpu.cost-flash-ns=9`, for example.
  These are effective calibrated costs, not a cache or pipeline simulation.
  See [CPU and SD refit](x4prosim/sdcal/cpu.md) for probe residuals, page
  rendering measurements, clock validation, and the current 30-row SD table.
- GPSPI2 completes CPU transfers on a virtual-clock timer. `SPI_CLOCK` selects
  an 80 MHz APB clock divided by `(clkdiv_pre + 1) * (clkcnt_n + 1)`, or 80 MHz
  directly with `clk_equ_sysclk`. The rate is sampled for each transaction, so
  the SD card's 40 MHz and the panel's 10 MHz both consume their wire time.
  `CMD.USR` stays set until the bytes reach the slave and `TRANS_DONE` is raised.
  All GPSPI setup properties are uint32 and default to zero on other boards.
  The X3 adds 700 ns per transaction (`transaction-overhead-ns`) and 300 ns
  for transfers longer than one byte (`buffer-overhead-ns`). These effective
  setup costs were re-fitted with the calibrated CPU driver time: commands
  take about 22 µs and read transfers about 147 µs per sector. The older
  `transaction-overhead-us` property remains additive. Setting either base
  overhead property explicitly suppresses the X3's default base overhead.
  For example, `-global driver=ssi.esp32s3.gpspi,property=transaction-overhead-us,value=0`
  clears the base cost; also set `buffer-overhead-ns=0` with the same explicit
  syntax to remove the buffered cost. The explicit form is needed because the
  device type contains dots. Both SD and panel transactions use these costs.
- SD timing uses virtual-clock deadlines, including under
  `-icount shift=0,sleep=on`. Polling reads return `0xff` until a data token is
  ready; polling writes return busy (`0x00`) after the data response token.
  The following `ssi-sd` properties are in microseconds (uint32 except the
  signed `write-stop-decrement-us`). Their generic defaults are zero; the X3 values are calibrated against three boots of the
  supplied card at 40 MHz, using the unchanged SdFat SHARED-mode probe.
  See [the calibration notes](x4prosim/sdcal/cpu.md) for all 30 rows,
  residual errors, raw emulator output and reproduction steps.

  | Property | X3 default (µs) | Interval |
  | --- | ---: | --- |
  | `read-access-us` | 207 | R1 to the first CMD17/CMD18 token for a random start |
  | `read-seq-access-us` | 136 | Same interval immediately after the last completed read block |
  | `read-repeat-us` | 108 | Same interval when repeating the previous read command's start |
  | `read-next-us` | 9 | End of one CMD18 block's CRC to the next token |
  | `write-busy-us` | 554 | CMD24 busy after a sequential write's data response |
  | `write-random-busy-us` | 621 | CMD24 busy for a random start |
  | `write-repeat-busy-us` | 479 | CMD24 busy for a repeated start |
  | `write-block-busy-us` | 10 | Busy after every CMD25 block's data response |
  | `write-stop-busy-us` | 480 | Base busy time after CMD25 STOP_TRAN |
  | `write-stop-decrement-us` | -40 | Signed reduction per CMD25 block; negative adds busy time |
  | `write-stop-random-extra-us` | 100 | Extra stop busy for a random command start |

  STOP_TRAN busy is `max(0, base + random_extra - decrement * blocks)`, clamped
  to UINT32_MAX microseconds. SdFat does not wait after STOP_TRAN: any remaining
  busy time appears in the next command's pre-wait. The firmware also spends
  time preparing that operation, so the measured command residual is shorter
  than the card's deadline. This deterministic model fits median totals; it does
  not reproduce the card's long write stalls or every phase distribution.
  `write-busy-us` and `write-random-busy-us` now apply only to CMD24;
  `write-block-busy-us` independently controls CMD25.

  Override any value with, for example,
  `-global ssi-sd.read-access-us=200 -global ssi-sd.write-block-busy-us=15`.
  Read and write histories are independent. Repeated start is checked before
  sequential start; the first access is random. No R1 response delay is added.
  Trace decisions and bus transactions with
  `-d 'trace:ssi_sd_*,trace:esp32s3_gpspi_*' -D spi-timing.log`, or use
  `--trace 'enable=ssi_sd_*' --trace 'enable=esp32s3_gpspi_*'`.
  Setting all card latency properties to zero disables only card delays;
  transfers still consume their wire time and configured GPSPI setup time.
- The panel model is simpler than the UC8179's: register LUTs move the ink per
  phase ((frames - `dead-frames`) / `swing-frames` of the way, so a one-frame
  balance pulse does nothing), without animation or ghosting. The partial
  window (0x90) and TRES are honored. BUSY uses the longest of VCOM and the four
  transition rows, with a fixed refresh overhead. X3 UC8253 defaults are
  `frame-us=12850`, `refresh-overhead-us=138000`, `pon-ms=127`, `pof-ms=2`:
  fast 382 ms, grayscale pre-BW 485 ms, gray 228 ms, full 935 ms. Every setting
  accepts a `-global uc8279.<property>=<value>` override; `busy-ms` fixes DRF
  duration when nonzero. UC8279d retains generic 20000/0/2/2 defaults.
  PLL (0x30) scales the frame period relative to the driver's init value
  (0x09 UC8253, 0x0f UC8279d); its family-table mapping remains provisional.
  Trace per-row totals with `-d trace:uc8279_refresh -D panel.trace`.
  See [panel calibration](x4prosim/sdcal/panel.md) for the fit, measured waits,
  LUT repeat semantics, and limitations.
- A cold boot needs the power button held (the firmware re-sleeps otherwise):
  `x3-keys.power-boot-ms` (default 1500) holds it from reset.
- CrossPoint up to 1.6.5 deadlocks on a first boot whose NVS has no cached device
  type: the X3 fingerprint probe runs `Wire.begin/end`, then `getWakeupReason`
  reads the gauge through raw `Wire` calls with the bus down, and the failed
  `endTransmission` keeps the Wire lock, so the IMU init blocks forever. A device
  that has booted once has `cphw/dev_det` in NVS and skips the probe, which is why
  nobody sees it. `mkflash.sh` seeds exactly that key (`mknvs.py`) on C3 images.
- `mksd.py` needs `mkfs.vfat` and `mcopy` (`brew install dosfstools mtools`; the
  build needs `brew install libslirp` too).
- Serial control (CrossPoint's `scripts/debugging_monitor.py` / `device_control.py`
  from the serial-device-control branch): give the console a pty instead of stdio,
  `-chardev pty,id=cdc` (QEMU prints the `/dev/ttysN` it made on stdout), and start
  the monitor on that path: `debugging_monitor.py --serve --headless /dev/ttysN`.
  PRESS/STATE/CANCEL/SCREENSHOT work as on the device; a 52 KB screenshot takes ~0.5 s.
  Verified 2026-10-09 with the X3/X4 develop build plus that branch (28-step scenario:
  Home, Browse Files, reader page turns, reader menu, hold/cancel, Settings, Library).
- `hw/sd/ssi-sd.c` fixes for SdFat: R3/R7 carry the real idle bit (CMD58 after
  ACMD41 is 0x00), a write's data token right after R1 is taken (no fill byte),
  CMD13 answers an SPI R2.
- Wi-Fi: the S3's radio models (regstub, ana, fe, Wi-Fi MAC with the fake AP) are
  wired for every C3 machine too; `run.sh` adds the NIC like on the X4 Pro. SYSCON's
  first 0x20 bytes are a register stub so the PHY's clock-enable assert passes
  (Settings > Manage Fonts starts Wi-Fi and crashed on it).
- Not modeled: the frontlight (the X3 has none), USB MSC, flash encryption.

## Helper agent task: GPSPI2 DMA + hardware CS (current)

Goal: firmware that drives the panel with ESP-IDF `spi_master` or Arduino `SPI`
using DMA and the controller's own CS works like CrossDink's CPU-mode SPI does
today. Branch `ext/spi-dma` off `x4prosim`, PR into `x4prosim`. You own
`hw/ssi/esp32s3_gpspi.c` for this task (and its wiring in `x4pro_board_init`).

Starting point: branch **`wip/spi-dma`** (598cb63) has an untested draft. It
compiles, but nothing has exercised it: GDMA out/in through the `esp_gdma`
API (`esp_gdma_get_channel_periph(GDMA_SPI2)`, read/write channel), command,
address and dummy phases, MOSI-only/MISO-only/full-duplex, a `cs0` output
(CS0_DIS, CS_KEEP_ACTIVE), and the panel CS = GPIO13 AND SPI CS0. Review it
against the S3 TRM and IDF `hal/esp32s3/include/hal/spi_ll.h` and fix what's wrong.

1. **DMA**: `spi_master` uses GDMA above 64 bytes (`SPI_DMA_CONF` TX/RX enable,
   GDMA PERI_SEL = 0 for SPI2). Check `esp_gdma_get_channel_periph`: it also
   matches any started channel, so a second DMA user (AES/SHA) could be picked.
   GDMA here only reaches internal DRAM; PSRAM buffers (EDMA) are a known gap:
   either add PSRAM to the GDMA address space or log a guest error.
2. **Interrupts and status**: TRANS_DONE plus whatever `spi_master`'s ISR and
   polling path read (check `spi_ll_usr_is_done`, `SPI_DMA_INT_*`, CMD.UPDATE,
   CMD.USR clearing). Transactions that queue back-to-back must work.
3. **Hardware CS**: CS0 goes low per transaction unless disabled or kept
   active. The GPIO matrix isn't modeled; CS0 is wired to the panel as if routed
   to GPIO13.
4. **Test firmware**: a minimal ESP-IDF (or Arduino) app in
   `x4prosim/tests/spi-dma/` that inits the X4 Pro panel pins
   (SCLK 12, MOSI 11, CS 13 as hardware CS, DC 18, RST 14, BUSY_N 6), sends
   UC8179 init + a 48000-byte DTM2 plane with one DMA transaction, refreshes
   (0x12), and prints "done". Commit its source and a build script, not the
   binary. Done when: `drive.py` screenshot shows the test pattern, and
   CrossDink 1007e still boots to Home with UC8179 promoted and a key press
   moving the selection (no regressions).

## Done helper task (merged): I2C bus + GT911 + BM8563 + CW2017

1. **ESP32-S3 I2C controller** `hw/i2c/esp32s3_i2c.c`: start from
   `hw/i2c/esp32_i2c.c` (ESP32 classic) and adapt it to the S3 register map (IDF
   `components/soc/esp32s3/register/soc/i2c_reg.h`, `hal/esp32s3/include/hal/i2c_ll.h`).
   Notable S3 changes: command registers at a new offset, the `CTR.CONF_UPGATE` bit
   that latches config, FIFO via `I2C_DATA_REG`, and different interrupt bits.
   Arduino 3.3.9 uses the IDF **i2c_master (ng) driver**, which is interrupt-driven.
   Wire both I2C0 and I2C1 into `hw/xtensa/esp32s3.c` with their interrupt-matrix
   sources. Done when: no more `ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` in the log and an I2C probe of
   a missing address NACKs cleanly.
2. **BM8563** `hw/rtc/bm8563.c` (PCF8563 register set, BCD time from the host clock,
   writes kept). Done when: the firmware's RTC read gives host time.
3. **CW2017** `hw/misc/cw2017.c`: chip ID, VCELL, SOC, and a profile/config
   register set that accepts the driver's init writes. Battery % and voltage as QOM
   properties (`-global`) and settable at runtime via `qom-set`. Read the
   freeink-sdk driver for the exact registers it touches (`rg -n "CW2017|Cw2017"` in
   the CrossDink `freeink-sdk/` submodule). Done when: the status bar shows the
   configured %.
4. **GT911** `hw/input/gt911.c`: product ID "911", config at 0x8047.., status 0x814E,
   points at 0x8150, buffer-status clear on write 0x814E=0, INT pulse on GPIO10: give
   the GT911 a named GPIO out and connect it to the GPIO model's `pin-in` line 10 in
   `x4pro_board_init`. Its power enable is GPIO2 and reset GPIO4: take them from
   `pin-out` lines 2 and 4. Touch input: QEMU mouse events (`qemu_input_handler_register`
   with absolute pointer) mapped to the 480x800 portrait raw space, plus an HMP/QMP-
   friendly QOM property or `-device` option for scripted taps. The Home key: one
   key code in the GT911 key area (check the freeink-sdk GT911 driver for how it reads
   it). Respect power: no ACKs while GPIO2 is HIGH (powered off). Done when: a scripted tap moves
   the firmware's selection (the log prints activity/input lines).

Read the freeink-sdk drivers in the CrossDink checkout before modeling:
`freeink-sdk/libs/hardware/` (touch, gauge, RTC, BoardConfig). Model what the driver
actually uses; don't implement whole datasheets.

Verification for every PR: build clean (no new warnings), boot the 1007e-or-newer
`x4-pro-debug` image with `run.sh` for 60 s, paste the relevant log lines in the PR,
and confirm no new hang (`info registers -a` PCs keep moving).

## Don'ts

- Don't modify any firmware (CrossDink, freeink-sdk or others). Don't change the GPIO, UC8179, keys or
  RTC_CNTL models (owned by the project thread; GPSPI is yours for the SPI DMA task); adding your devices' wiring lines to
  `x4pro_board_init` is fine. Ask in the PR if you need a hook elsewhere.
- Don't push to `x4prosim` directly. PRs only.
- No upstream references in PR titles, bodies or commits (no `#N` pointing at other
  repos, no `owner/repo#N`, no "fixes/closes" keywords).
