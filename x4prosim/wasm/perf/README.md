# X3 phase profiling

These tools measure the CrossPoint X3 boot without changing firmware. See
[turbo-profile.md](turbo-profile.md) for the measured costs and recommendations.
They use only Python's standard library and Node's built-in profiler. Native
sampling additionally requires macOS `sample` and permission to inspect the
emulator process. Run from any directory; default binaries and output paths
are relative to this repository, found from the script location.

Build the normal native and default Wasm emulators using the
[WebAssembly guide](../../../X4PROSIM.md#webassembly-build), then set paths to
original input images. Each run makes its own copies; originals are not written.
On APFS, `cp -c` avoids physically copying the whole sparse SD image.

```sh
export X3_FLASH=/absolute/path/to/x3-flash.bin
export X3_SD=/absolute/path/to/sd.img
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/benchmark.py --help
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/benchmark.py
```

The default is three interleaved native/Wasm runs with `sleep=off`. Home is
the third completed `X3_DRF` refresh. The second phase ends at the first
complete subsequent `[MEM]` line, then the harness captures the named `panel`
console and quits normally. It checks all screenshots and the first eight
guest wait timestamps against the first run. Output directories must be new,
so an accidental rerun cannot silently overwrite evidence.

`--native-bin`, `--wasm-build`, `--node`, `--flash`, `--sd`, `--runs`,
`--variants`, `--output` and `--timeout` override defaults. `--sleep on` is
available, but exact timestamp comparisons are disabled because idle-time
warping includes host scheduling variation. `home-probe.py` provides the same
CLI stopped at Home; it does not check the later screenshot/timestamps.

Keep timing runs separate from profiles, instrumented counters and builds.
On a shared host, preserve interleaving and inspect each run as well as medians.
The scripts cannot reserve CPU time or make other workers quiet.

```sh
# Node: one full CPU profile per pthread; analyzer crops at phase markers.
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/benchmark.py --variants wasm --profile node \
  --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/node-cpu
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/analyze-profile.py \
  build-wasm/evidence/profile/node-cpu/wasm-{1,2,3} \
  --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/node-analysis.json

# Native: separate lifetimes prevent slow sampler initialization from
# accidentally including thumbnail work in the startup profile.
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/benchmark.py --variants native --profile native \
  --stop-at home --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-home
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/benchmark.py --variants native --profile native \
  --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-settled
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/analyze-profile.py \
  build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-home/native-{1,2,3} \
  --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-home-analysis.json
python3 x4prosim/wasm/perf/analyze-profile.py \
  build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-settled/native-{1,2,3} \
  --output build-wasm/evidence/profile/native-settled-analysis.json
```

`sample` starts at launch for Home-only runs and after Home for settled runs;
SIGINT ends sampling at the selected milestone. Startup/attachment overhead
can leave a sampling gap. Inspect `.stderr` and sample counts; reject a capture
that extends beyond its phase. This is statistical sampling, not exact CPU
accounting. Native tables report self sample counts; Node reports weighted
elapsed samples, including waits. Profiles are excluded from timing medians.

The analyzer selects the vCPU thread by symbols, not a hard-coded thread ID.
`--thread mainloop` selects the QEMU main-loop thread; Node also supports
`--thread js-main`. Do not add their elapsed samples together as wall time.
Device functions map to source files. Generated Wasm TBs are grouped by their
separate module URLs. Visible Asyncify frames exclude instrumentation inlined
into other functions. Top wait stacks retain callers so mutex contention and
synchronous JavaScript proxy waits are distinguishable.

`profile-hooks.cjs` measures only hot-TB synchronous module construction and
instantiation, not V8 background optimizing compilation. `node-cpu-prof.sh`
is an optional `NODE` wrapper for `run-node.sh`; set `TURBO_PROFILE_DIR` to an
absolute output directory. Node must quit normally to flush worker profiles.
V8 CPU-profile timestamps are checked against Python monotonic markers;
constructor events use a recorded wall/monotonic offset because Node
`process.hrtime()` has a different origin on this macOS host.

Temporary counter sources/builds and their restoration script live in
`build-wasm/evidence/profile/`, as cited by the report; no QEMU instrumentation
is enabled by this directory. `summarize-counters.py` extracts their phase
snapshots, and `make-report.py` regenerates the report's measurement tables.
Raw profiles, images and logs stay in ignored build directories.
