# X3 SD/SPI calibration

The current X3 defaults use nanosecond CPU costs and a re-fitted SPI setup and
SD stop-busy model. See [CPU calibration and SD refit](cpu.md) for the current
values, 30-row validation, and reading measurements; the values below document
the original plain-instruction-count calibration at `icount shift=2`.


All 30 median totals meet the requested limits: the largest absolute error is
**2.92% for reads** (limit 5%) and **13.12% for writes** (limit 15%). The unchanged
probe completed 60 groups / 2,880 operations with zero errors and reached Home.
The device reference pools three boots, 288 operations per row; the emulator
run has 96 operations per row. This calibration targets 40 MHz SPI with
`-icount shift=2,sleep=on` and the probe's SdFat SHARED-mode access pattern.

The implementation extends commits `8796d32dc6` and `9e4b81d58d`; the calibration
commit is titled `x4prosim: calibrate SPI SD timing against the X3 card`.

## Median totals

Each row compares the same operation, start-sector pattern and sector count.
`rep` repeats the previous start, `seq` starts after the previous end, and `rnd`
uses a nonadjacent start. Error is `(emulator / device - 1) * 100`.

| Op | Pattern | Sectors | Device median (us) | Emulator median (us) | Error |

## Final defaults and mechanism

Generic defaults remain zero. Only X3 receives the calibrated defaults below;
X4 Pro continues to use its clock-derived bus duration with zero setup costs.

| Device | Property | X3 value | Units / scope |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| GPSPI | `transaction-overhead-us` | 0 | Microseconds, additive base setup |
| GPSPI | `transaction-overhead-ns` | 1450 | Nanoseconds on every transaction |
| GPSPI | `buffer-overhead-ns` | 1875 | Extra nanoseconds when the transaction has more than one byte |
| SSI SD | `read-access-us` | 207 | Random first-token deadline from R1 |
| SSI SD | `read-seq-access-us` | 136 | Sequential first-token deadline |
| SSI SD | `read-repeat-us` | 108 | Repeated-start first-token deadline |
| SSI SD | `read-next-us` | 12 | CRC end to next CMD18 token |
| SSI SD | `write-busy-us` | 554 | Sequential CMD24 data-response busy |
| SSI SD | `write-random-busy-us` | 621 | Random CMD24 busy |
| SSI SD | `write-repeat-busy-us` | 479 | Repeated-start CMD24 busy |
| SSI SD | `write-block-busy-us` | 10 | Every CMD25 block's data-response busy |
| SSI SD | `write-stop-busy-us` | 480 | STOP_TRAN base busy |
| SSI SD | `write-stop-decrement-us` | 26 | Busy reduction per completed CMD25 block |
| SSI SD | `write-stop-random-extra-us` | 205 | Extra STOP busy for a random-start command |

STOP busy is `max(0, 480 + (random ? 205 : 0) - 26 * blocks)` microseconds,
with the general property calculation saturated at UINT32_MAX. The command's
start pattern is retained through every block and STOP. Repeated starts take
precedence over sequential starts, and read/write histories are independent.
CMD24 now uses the existing `write-busy-us` / `write-random-busy-us` names plus
`write-repeat-busy-us`; CMD25 uses the independent `write-block-busy-us`.

The guest's existing instruction and polling time is part of each measured
phase, so configured deadlines are not identical to observed phase durations.
A bus-only probe with 2 us fixed setup produced 27 us commands but 137 us read
transfers, versus 22/147 us on the device. One constant could not fit both:
the final base setup plus buffered setup produces 22 us commands and about
146–147 us per read block without changing SCLK or firmware.

The initial device estimates of roughly 107/135/204 us first-token waits and
470/545/610 us single-write waits guided the respective properties. The
12 us CMD18 gap and 10 us CMD25 block busy come from the measured sustained
block behavior. The post-stop fit differs from the proposed B=445/D=57 because
the firmware prepares the next write buffer while the deadline elapses:
roughly 85/150/275 us is already gone before the next 2/4/8-sector command.
The emulator must not charge that preparation a second time.

## Phase comparison and limits

Pairs below are **device / emulator median microseconds**. Meeting total-time
tolerances does not imply an exact fit to every phase or to the device's tails.

The largest write residuals are random 2-sector writes (+10.99%) and random
8-sector writes (-13.12%). The supplied table's random 8-sector command phase
is 411 us, contradicting the preliminary suggestion that all n>=8 writes have
no residual stop busy. A single linear stop-credit rule with a random-start
premium cannot reproduce that shape exactly: this fit gives 222 us there and
568 us for random n=2 (device 458 us), while keeping every total within 15%.
No per-row lookup table or random noise was added to hide the discrepancy.

Repeated 32-sector reads are 2.92% fast; their wait phase is 467 us versus
539 us on the device. Sequential 8-sector reads are 2.14% slow; their wait
phase is 215 us versus 159.5 us. The common 12 us inter-block deadline fits the
required totals without pretending to reproduce the card's complete read-ahead
behavior. Single-write phase differences also include the guest's instruction
and poll granularity. Long device programming stalls, including the pathological
sequential single-write boot, are not simulated; pooled medians were used.

The probe reports `cpu=160,type=3` (SDHC) on the device and `cpu=80,type=2`
(SDSC) in this emulator configuration. No CPU-clock or firmware changes were
made to conceal that difference. Guest microsecond measurements, not the
reported CPU frequency, are the calibration target; SDSC/SDHC address handling
is covered by the adapter checks. Other firmware, icount settings, DMA paths,
cards, occupancy, wear and clock rates require separate validation.

## Reproduce and evidence

The raw emulator console (`calibration-console.log`, kept with the session evidence, not in git) contains all 2,880 operations,
`DONE groups=60 ops=2880 errors=0`, and `Entering activity: Home`.
The copied runner changes only the host launcher to use no shared monitor
socket or GUI, accepts optional `SD_TIMING_EXTRA` QEMU arguments and allows
600 seconds for host execution. It never edits or flashes the probe firmware.

From this worktree after `ninja -C build`:

```sh
mkdir -p /tmp/sdcal
x4prosim/mkflash.sh /Users/serialx/orca/workspaces/crosspoint-reader/sd-timing-probe/.pio/build/default /tmp/sdcal/flash.bin
python3 x4prosim/mksd.py /tmp/sdcal/sd.img 512
python3 x4prosim/sdcal/run_qemu.py "$PWD" "$PWD//tmp/sdcal"
python3 x4prosim/sdcal/parse.py /tmp/sdcal/console.log --json /tmp/sdcal/results.json
python3 x4prosim/sdcal/compare.py device-results.json /tmp/sdcal/console.log
```

The reference inputs remain unchanged in the worktree root. Their pooled JSON
sets `complete=false` because its parser expects exactly one DONE marker; the
input actually contains three successful DONE records, totaling 8,640 operations.
The comparison checks 30 rows and the emulator's 96 samples per row explicitly.
All writable flash/card images and logs are in this worktree. No physical device
or other checkout was modified.

Both targets build with no warnings in the changed files; the linker still
prints the pre-existing duplicate `-liconv` warning. Exact X4 Pro qtest checks
cover additive microsecond/nanosecond setup, buffered-only setup, USR and timer
boundaries, and UC8179 delivery/BUSY. QMP verifies all X3 defaults and explicit
overrides, including zero. Isolated adapter tests with a mock SDBus cover repeated,
sequential and random SDSC/SDHC access, the CMD24/CMD25 split, STOP credit,
zero defaults, and uint32 saturation under ASan/UBSan. The probe itself exercises
the actual SD backend, including written-sector verification. Existing X3 CPU
initialization still prevents the qtest accelerator from running that machine;
its firmware runs under TCG. End-to-end migration was not tested.
